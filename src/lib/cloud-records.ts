 * whose clock reads 2030 would otherwise win every conflict for years, and the
 * device that lost would keep losing with no way to state a newer edit.
 *
 * A record this device has changed but not yet pushed is held back instead:
 * `dirty` names those, the push that follows this merge sends them, and they
 * come home stamped. So the rule is the server's order, with the local edit
 * that has not had its turn yet still waiting for one.
 *
 * The result is repaired rather than validated: two devices can each make a
 * legal change that is illegal together, and a merge that could fail would
 * strand the account with no way back.
